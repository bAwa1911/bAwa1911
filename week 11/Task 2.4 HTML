p:first-of-type {
  font: 0.17em/1.33 Verdana, sans-serif;
}
There is something special going on here. It is what is called a short-hand property. So instead of writing out:

p:first-of-type {
  font-size: 0.17em;
  line-height: 1.33;
  font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
}
You can write just one line:

p:first-of-type {
  font: 0.17em/1.33 Verdana, sans-serif;
}
